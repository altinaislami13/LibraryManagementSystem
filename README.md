# LibraryManagementSystem

PROJECT OVERVIEW
This project is an Advanced Library Management System developed as a C# Console Application.
It follows Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles and fulfills all academic core requirements.

The system allows managing a library with Books, Magazines, and DVDs.
Users can view items, borrow and return them, navigate items using pagination, and all data is stored permanently using JSON file persistence.

This project demonstrates clean architecture, professional coding practices, and correct use of OOP concepts.
